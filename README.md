# Fun-With-Fractions

Author: Maria Rodriguez
Version: September 2023 Miniproject 2

This repository has 4 .java files. BigFraction.java is an extension of the Fraction.java class I had worked 
on in Lab "Subtype polymorphism in Java" with my partner Lydia. It contains all the fields, constructors, 
and methods BigFraction will utilize. BFCalculator.java has an evaluate and store method. 
InteractiveCalculator.java is a calculator that takes in user inputted expressions and calculates them, 
always returning the result in simplest form. QuickCalculator.java is a calculator that takes in multiple
expressions and evaluates them in order from left to right.

Acknowledgements:
  - Peter guided me towards creating a result field that will store the result in the calclator's memory
  - When I needed a way to check if a string was just a character, Kevin (F.) pointed me towards the
    .codePointAt() method.
